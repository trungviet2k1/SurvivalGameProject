  initialDialogue:
  - 'Hey, I didn''t expect to meet anyone out here.

    I''m Luna, I live in the
    nearby village'
  - I supposed to help my father get rabbit hides. He is a famous-worker in out village.
  - He will never say this, but I know he wanted to have a son. One that could help
    him with the family business and take over it someday. Sometimes I just feel
    like a disappointment...

    fluffy and cute. I feel so useless.
  - Wait! Maybe you can help me? Don't worry, I will pay you.
